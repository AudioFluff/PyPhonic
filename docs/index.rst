PyPhonic
========

These are the docs for PyPhonic, a VST plugin that enables using Python to process MIDI and audio in the DAW.

PyPhonic works two ways,

1. Running Python code directly in the plugin, inside the DAW.

2. Streaming audio and MIDI from the DAW to a Python process running as a server somewhere outside the DAW.

.. note:: The VST plugin has finally been released on 27 June 2024 and is available for purchase.
          Find it in the `KVRAudio marketplace <https://www.kvraudio.com/product/pyphonic-by-audio-fluff>`_.
