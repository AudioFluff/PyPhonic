PyPhonic
========

These are the docs for PyPhonic, a VST plugin that enables using Python to process MIDI and audio in the DAW.

PyPhonic works two ways,

1. Running Python code directly in the plugin, inside the DAW.

2. Streaming audio and MIDI from the DAW to a Python process running as a server somewhere outside the DAW.

.. note:: The VST plugin hasn't been released yet - expected May 2024!
